# RISC-V and Other Computer Architecture Projects

This project involves the design and implementation of a basic RISC-V processor core using Verilog. The core is based on the RV32I instruction set, which is a subset of the RISC-V ISA. The goal is to create a fully functional processor that can execute a range of instructions including arithmetic, logical, memory, and control operations.

### Key Components
1. Arithmetic Logic Unit
2. Control Unit
3. Program Counter
4. Data Memory
5. Instruction Memory
6. Register File
7. SRAM with R/W/S features
